# ChallengeMe
This repository contains my group's CS 411 (Databases) project, which was done in 2015. I am uploading it to Github as a means to save the project online. Since I have graduated from school, I no longer host the project using my school account. The project is currently not hosted anywhere. As a result, one cannot currently use the project; but, only view the code.  

My contribution to this project is coding half of the HTML files and all of the PHP files. Disclaimer: Since I do not code PHP on a daily (or even yearly) basis, I cannot say I am fluent in PHP.
